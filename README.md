## Bakery Link

Bakery Link is a web application that will make ordering custom cakes and baked goods ... a piece of cake! It is a full-stack MERN application that allows customers to order custom cakes and baked goods. Bakeries can use it to manage orders and keep track of inventory in an online database.

### How It Works
* There are two ways to sign up for Bakery Link: as a customer or as a bakery.
* Customers can fill in an order form with specifications for a custom cake such as size, flavor, buttercream flavors, as well as quantities for cookies and/or cupcakes. MapQuest is used to show the customer their saved location and when an order is submitted, the location shown is changed to the location of the bakery in the last submitted order until the screen is refreshed. Customers can also view a list of their previous orders and see the status of those submitted orders.
* Bakery staff can fill in an order form with the same specifications, or update existing orders with price and status.
* Bakery staff can view available inventory which will be displayed in charts. 
* Bakery staff can also view orders that have been made in a table and in a list with details.
